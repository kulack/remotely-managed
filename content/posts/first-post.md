Nice to meet you. I'm Fred.

Welcome to the Remotely Managed blog. I'm here to talk about
my interests in technology and Digi Remote Manager.

I work for Digi Interational, as a senior engineer, on Digi Remote Manager. [Remote Manager](https://www.digi.com/products/iot-software-services/digi-remote-manager). Remote Manager lets you manage your large fleet of Digi IoT devices. We have a lot of features, the normal sort of "list your device inventory", "do firmware updates" to the more esoteric "run automation scripts against all your devices", "update settings on every device in your fleet" and other things.

None of the things I'm going to write here come from my company and I'm going to be writing about my personal experiences with technology and Remote Manager and some of the things that interest me most about it.

Enough of the marketing... Why am I here?

Sigh... Right away to the *big* questions?

I'm not really a writer or author, but I like to share information about the technical things I work on.

I've been spending a lot of time at home recently. My local office closed in 2021. We migrated from working in the office to full time work-from-home.

The change was mostly due to COVID and normal adjustments that occurred all over the world as a result.

Being remotely managed works well for IoT devices but not always for humans and its been rather challenging for me. As a result, I thought I would see what I could do to help people engage with the software I work on and also hopefully get some interaction with some of
you.

I don't know how frequent I'll be writing, I hope you'll read occasionally.

Thank you!
Fred.
